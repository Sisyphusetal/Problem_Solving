/*Prompt: A computer application needs to be able to identify if a written paragraph is 
written in First, Second, or Third Person.*/

/*One strategy to use this program would be to write the paragraph to a text file and
then assing it to an array, then traverse the array to search for keywords indicating
perspective the paragraph is written in.*/

//First the paragraph would be made into a .txt file and then linked to an array
//Then a for loop should traverse the array
        //Ideally it could look for keywords like "me", "I", "his/he", "hers/her"
        //Likely achieved through an if statement
//Add to separate counts indicating the frequency of either type of language
//Highest count should then reference what perspective it is likely to be in

/*The most difficult part of problem solving is identifying what the actual problem is.
If the general concept of the program is incorrectly or too vaguely conveyed in the beginning,
then the problem solving process is flawed from its conception, and so it is likely that any
solution that follows will not actually solve the problem, but instead solve whatever was
erroneously posed as the problem in the beginning.*/
